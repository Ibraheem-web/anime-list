The series has been serialized biweekly on Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+ application and website since March 2019, with the chapters collected in eleven tankōbon volumes as of April 2023. It was licensed in North America by Viz Media.

An anime television series adaptation produced by Wit Studio and CloverWorks premiered on TV Tokyo and its affiliate stations in April 2022, and was licensed by Muse Communication in Asia and Crunchyroll worldwide. The second half aired from October to December 2022. A second season is set to premiere in October 2023 and an anime film, titled Spy × Family Code: White, will release on December 22, 2023.
